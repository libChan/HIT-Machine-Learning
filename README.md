Used to record the experiment and learning notes in the machine learning course of Harbin Institute of Technology.

## Lab1

### Target

- Use function $f = sin(2\pi x)$ to generate sample points and add gaussian noise
- Fit curves with polynomial regression. The least square method(**LSE**), gradient descent method(**GD**) and conjugate gradient method(**CG**) are used to solve the problem.
- When calculating the loss function,  compare **regularization with non-regularization**.
- After many experiments, I compared the results of different order numbers, different learning rate and different data quantities.
- During the lab,  we could research the method of **overcoming the overfitting.**

Lab was implemented with **Python**.  For more details, see **Project_Lab1**
